- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Catja!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and currently improving my Machine Learning skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also looking to do more research in Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications for Computer Vision!

My current project is the implementation of a CNN from scratch using PyTorch's Custom NN Modules.
This is to gain a better understanding how CNN's work :)
